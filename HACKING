simple editing tips:
if you just want to make a small addition or changing an asset,
edit the asset files without changing their filename,
also make sure the edited files retain same size/dimension/format,
then re render/export the video again with shotcut.

some text are an plain image (from renders.svg),
some are shotcut filters (inside shotcut itself),
check those both when editing text files.
